## Day 4 (Thursday) - Educational

[Hook] Stop paying for 6 different marketing tools

[Body] Here's what most businesses do:
- Pay for a copywriting tool
- Pay for an image generator
- Pay for a video editor
- Pay for a scheduler
- Pay for analytics

That's $500-2000/month and 15+ hours managing them all.

The result? Your brand voice is inconsistent and you're exhausted.

Here's the alternative: One platform with a Brand Brain that keeps everything on-voice, plus AI operators that handle execution.
